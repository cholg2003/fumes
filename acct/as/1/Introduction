Introduction

I'm sister Mary Atimango. I belong to the congregation of the sacred Heart of Jesus. Working as a peace builder at the grassroot after being trained as the T.O.T on nonviolence by Pax Christi International in 2022.
I do train in schools mainly our own school due to transport problem. I train in our formation house (the postulancy) becuase our Noviate is in Uganda. I train the motorcycle riders in the near by station. I also train the street kids and I went further on training the gangs I started with six(6) of them but now the number has increased to 30. And we call them St. Paul Youth.

Achievements
The gangs have surrender their tools and now absorbed in the community. In the school there was alot of fighting, teachers on duty were solving problems everyday but now the learners in Sacred Heart Secondary School do solve their own problems
